# Live, Virtual, Constructive

## LVC

LVC is a fundamental concept in DoD simulations, and reflect efforts by the military to blur the lines between simulation and reality.

*Live* entities represent real entities controlled by real people. An actual physical ship piloted a real person is a live entity, as is a real dismounted soldier equipped with a GPS and a radio. Both entities can transmit position and orientation information that can be ingested into simulations. The simulation consumer can't tell at first glance whether the entity being displayed on the screen is real or simulated.

*Virutal* entities are simulated entities controlled by real people. A simulation user sitting in an aircraft simulator may generate position and orientation updates. The person controlling the simulated aircraft is real, but the aircraft is not.

*Constructive* entities are simulated entities controlled by simulated people. Often simulations need large numbers of simulated entities to train users. It's unreasonable to have individuals control them, so instead they are controlled by Artificial Intelligence (AI) or, to use a less grandiose term, algorithms. A red force rifle regiment may have hundreds of vehicles, each of them controlled by software. 

These distinctions between types of entities in simulations has turned out to be useful in practice. DIS entities can be either live, virtual, or constructive. In practice, DIS entities are most often either virtual or constructive.
